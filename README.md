# Ammonia Sales Platform

## Project Overview
`Ammonia Sales Platform` is a minimal full-stack prototype for recording ammonia sale transactions through a one-button workflow.

The application demonstrates a complete end-to-end system:
**frontend → backend → database**, fully containerized and deployable.

Users can select an amount of ammonia (in kg) using a slider and record a sale with a single button click. Each transaction is processed by the backend and stored in a SQLite database.

This repository fulfills the technical deliverable requirements:
- Fully functioning one-button app
- Backend API with database integration
- Dockerized and cloud-deployable
- Runnable in GitHub Codespaces

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend (`frontend/`)**  
  Static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript served via Nginx

- **Backend (`backend/`)**  
  Node.js with Express REST API

- **Database (`backend/db/sales.db`)**  
  SQLite database storing transactions

- **Containerization**  
  Docker + Docker Compose for reproducible environments

## System Flow

1. User opens the application
2. User selects ammonia amount using the slider
3. User clicks **Record Sale**
4. Frontend sends a request to backend
5. Backend validates input and calculates price
6. Sale is stored in database
7. UI updates with confirmation and latest data
